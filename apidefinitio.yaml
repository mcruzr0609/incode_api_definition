      Following endpoints facilitate API key rotation, for security reasons - current key gets stolen, user access needs
      to be revoked, organization expires, etc. It is good practice to rotate them every once in a while, regardless
      (e.g. every three months).

      **Migration**
      There used to be only one API key per organization, created and registered on API Gateway at the time of organization
      creation. Each organization has a user defined `name`, on which 3 random digits are added to generate `clientId`,
      on which sha1 was applied to generate `apiKey`. Field `clientId` was also used as organization identifier, while
      `apiKey` also served as organization reference.

      With the rotatable approach, API key management is delegated to a separate collection, which would contain `clientId`
      and `value` for each record. This also enables having multiple API keys per organization. Fields `clientId`/`apiKey`
      on organization entity will keep their identifier/reference function, to maintain referential integrity between entities.

      In order to facilitate the new approach and ensure backwards compatibility, a migration process is established.
      Through it, API key related fields are copied from Organization to RotatableApiKey collection, so that in the end
      each organization would have a corresponding rotatable key created. Key validity is checked on API Gateway directly
      (if applicable, otherwise set to `true`). All subsequent API key management would affect new collection only.

            In case there's some issue when calling the endpoint due to classification failed, an issue such as bad quality,
            or any of the fail reasons the response will always have the field:
            - classification
            - failReason
            - sharpness
            - glare
            - horizontalResolution

            We recommend considering the call as failed if there's a failReason in the response or if the classification is false.
            Possible values for fail reason:
            - UNKNOWN_DOCUMENT_TYPE: document classification failed
            - WRONG_DOCUMENT_SIDE: can happen when uploading back side of id when front id is required or the other way around
            - WRONG_ONE_SIDED_DOCUMENT: uploading wrong document with only one side
            - WRONG_UNFOLDED_DOCUMENT: uploading unfolded document with unrecognizable sides
            - UNFOLDED_DOCUMENT_PAGE_MISMATCH: uploading unfolded document with mismatching sides
            - DOCUMENT_NOT_READABLE: document couldn't be read, probably due to image quality
            - UNABLE_TO_ALIGN_DOCUMENT: alignment failed
            - ID_TYPE_UNACCEPTABLE: invalid type of id
            - UNEXPECTED_ERROR_OCCURRED: unexpected error

            Whenever the classification is done successfully the fields that will always be present are:
            - classification
            - sharpness
            - glare
            - horizontalResolution
            - readability
            - typeOfId
            - sessionStatus

            The remaining fields could be optional depending on the specific type of id and country of origin.

        This endpoint is used for storing back side of id for further processing. Image quality check is performed during that call.
        Number of retries is not limited.

        Once [process-id](#/Onboarding/processId) is finished, this endpoint cannot be called for retries.

        **Note**: Front-side of id should be uploaded before back side.

        In case of passport or only front sided documents, this endpoint should not be called.

            In case there's some issue when calling the endpoint due to classification failed, an issue such as bad quality,
            or any of the fail reasons the response will always have the field:
            - classification
            - failReason
            - sharpness
            - glare
            - horizontalResolution

            We recommend considering the call as failed if there's a failReason in the response or if the classification is false.
            Possible values for fail reason:
            - UNKNOWN_DOCUMENT_TYPE: document classification failed
            - WRONG_DOCUMENT_SIDE: can happen when uploading back side of id when front id is required or the other way around
            - WRONG_ONE_SIDED_DOCUMENT: uploading wrong document with only one side
            - WRONG_UNFOLDED_DOCUMENT: uploading unfolded document with unrecognizable sides
            - UNFOLDED_DOCUMENT_PAGE_MISMATCH: uploading unfolded document with mismatching sides
            - DOCUMENT_NOT_READABLE: document couldn't be read, probably due to image quality
            - UNABLE_TO_ALIGN_DOCUMENT: alignment failed
            - ID_TYPE_UNACCEPTABLE: invalid type of id
            - UNEXPECTED_ERROR_OCCURRED: unexpected error

            Whenever the classification is done successfully the fields that will always be present are:
            - classification
            - sharpness
            - glare
            - horizontalResolution
            - readibility
            - typeOfId
            - sessionStatus

            The remaining fields could be optional depending on the specific type of id and country of origin.

      summary: Add face/Selfie image
      description: |
        Uploads selfie image for onboarding session. Response will contain data regarding liveness — if that is the photo of a real person.
        Number of retries is not limited.

        **Note**: After selfie and front-id are uploaded, endpoint for comparing faces process-face on those two images can be called.

        It is required that person is alone on the photo.

        Attach signature from interview to previously uploaded PDF contracts at all places annotated with text from request,
        with desired height on pdf. Annotations must contain text with either preselected values, or alternative can be supplied.
        If user wishes to use signature supplied during onboarding, DEFAULT signature type should be used.

        Preselected values are: DEFAULT, INITIALS, PATIENTS_SIGNATURE, NON_MEDICAL_SIGNATURE_1, NON_MEDICAL_SIGNATURE_2,
        MEDICAL_SIGNATURE_1, MEDICAL_SIGNATURE_2

        Endpoint is intended to be used as fluent api. One call to the api gives in responses id of the signed document which
        can then be used in the subsequent call to continuously add another signature on a different annotation.

      summary: Process government validation
      description: |
        This endpoint reads the country code from the interview which can be set at the moment of calling the start endpoint or
        is updated based on the processed id. Request body can optionally contain data from id in JSON. If omitted, data from
        scanned ID is read.

        **Country codes**:

        **MEX**: Mexico - INE Validation. When government face validation is enabled this method compares the user's selfie against

        Request parameters:
        - fallbackEnabled: Boolean, optional. If it is not sent, it will default to false.
        - scrapingMethod: Boolean, optional. If it is not sent, it will default to false.

        If parameter fallbackEnabled is true and there's some connection or infrastructure error with the INE service, validation by
